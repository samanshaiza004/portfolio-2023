Welcome to my _new blog_ on my website!

I want to share this project I made called "Pokemon Memory"

## What is Pokemon Memory?

Pokemon Memory is a, as the title suggests, Pokemon memory game.

The rules are simple!

1. **Pick the difficulty**: choose the amount of Pokemon you want to play with. _(You can pick up to 1000 Pokemon!)._

2. **Win**: select every single Pokemon once without selecting the same Pokemon twice!
