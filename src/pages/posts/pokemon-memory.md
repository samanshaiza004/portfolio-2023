Welcome to my _new blog_ on my website!

I want to share this project I made called "Pokemon Memory"

# What is Pokemon Memory?

Pokemon Memory is a, as the title suggests, Pokemon memory game.

The rules are simple!

1. **Pick the difficulty**: choose the amount of Pokemon you want to play with. _(You can pick up to 1000 Pokemon!)._

2. **Win**: select every single Pokemon once without selecting the same Pokemon twice!

Go check it out [here!](https://samshaiza.github.io/pokemon-memory/)

## How was it made?

This game was inspired by one of the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) React project's called 'Memory Card'. The project was really simple!

> The main goal of this project is to implement the concepts learned so far by using hooks to manage and utilize state while fetching and using data from an external API.

I opted to use the Pokemon API to fetch data from. I thought it'd be really cool, though a little impractical, to be able to play with all 1000+ Pokemon.

## What's next?

I plan on making a simple CRUD app with PostgreSQL and React.
